# Change log

## Version 0.2.4
* Added Hive integration for `score` command.
* Changed method name for existing logistic regression model based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm from `"logistic"` to `"logit_sgd"`.
* Added another logistics regression model implementation from sklearn with method name `"logit"`. This implementation is more robust than the existing SGD-based model.
* Added `manifold` command to create t-SNE and a page in dashboard to visualize the embeddings.
* Fixed the dependency installation issue and added a script to ease the installation.

## Version 0.2.3
* Added Hive integration when prepping the input data with `prep_spark`. Put your input data into a Hive table and prep it from there. The single csv input is deprecated for `prep_spark`, but still supported with the `prep` command.
* Additional and improved dashboard pages (feature importance from `explore` command, feature importance of final models and etc.)
* Dashboard address and port number are assigned automatically. You can still specify a port number, if you want to fix it.
* Column names are not case-sensitive anymore.
* Requires xgboost version == 0.4a30.

## Version 0.2.2
* Added a new command `dashboard` which displays various model performance charts and univariate analysis charts. The command `plot` is deprecated.
* Added option to customize undersampling rate for different targets.
* The outputs necessary for `score` command are now saved in `"path_to_output"/scoring/`.
* Exports a list of all necessary variables for `scoring` command.  
* Requires Bokeh version == 0.11.1.

## Version 0.2.1

* Now the data set prepraed in prep and prep_spark comamnd is identical if the same random seed is used.
* Fixed an issue that score command breaks when data is prepraed with prep command.
* Fixed an issue that more than specified # of variables are selected when there are ties.
* Fixed pandas csv parsing error when a variable has mixed types.
* Added option to not under-sample the majority non-event data.
* Added average model scores for each bin in univariate plots.
* Added a few command line options that can override the configuration file for 'score' command.
* Require Bokeh version >= 0.11.0.

## Version 0.2.0

* Added `scoring` command to score new data set with the best model in PySpark.
* Added option to build regularized logistic regression with SGDClassifier (Stochastic Gradient Descent) in scikit-learn.
* The bias in prediction from under-sampling is adjusted and the average scores and cumulative average scores are added to decile and percentile reports. 
* Added option to manually include or exclude variables in the variable importance report generated by `explore` command.
* Added option to add prefix to the link for univariate analysis plot.
* Label encoders and fill values for missing values from `prep_spark` command are indexed with variable name.

## Version 0.1.0

* Initial release.
